# The script is pretty simple. It checks for a reboot, disk full, and root partition full. If any of these checks fail, the script will exit with a non-zero exit code. This will cause the script to fail and the user will be notified.

# The script is run by the cron job every 5 minutes. The cron job is set up by the following line in the crontab file:
# this is new line
# */5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/automation/check_health.py

# The script is run every 5 minutes and the output is sent to the userâ€™s email address.

# Conclusion

# This is a simple example of how to use Python to automate tasks. The script can be modified to check for other things. For example, you can check for a specific file or directory. You can also check for a specific process or service. The possibilities are endless.

# If you have any questions or comments, please leave them below.
